This dataset include 36 healthy right-handed participants which completed the stages of the cue-approach training (CAT) paradigm (see Schonberg, T. et al. Changing value through cued approach: an automatic mechanism of behavior change. Nat. Neurosci. 17, 625â€“30 (2014) and Salomon, T. et al. The Cue-Approach Task as a General Mechanism for Long-Term Non-Reinforced Behavioral Change. Sci. Rep. 8, 3614 (2018)).

For each participant the following data is available for each session (before CAT, after CAT and for 27 participants a one-month follow-up session):
1. Behavioral BDM auction data on 60 snack-food items.
2. fMRI data from a passive viewing task (40 snack food items, two runs in each session). This task is named "esponsetosnacks" in the data files.
3. T1w (MPRAGE) image.
4. fMRI and behavioral data from the probe (binary choices) task (from the after and follow-up sessions).
In addition, behavioral data from the training task is also shared (.tsv files).

Note that the shared data is defaced, while the preprocessing of the fMRI data was performed prior to the defacing of the structural images.

There is a derivatives directory in which the following data is included:
* .txt files for the EVs of each first level analysis.
* .tsv files for the motion confounds of each first level analysis.
* design.fsf files for all levels of analyses.
* Masks for the small volume correction (SVC) analyses.
